# Medvita Embedded Software Code
All rights for all code written here reserved by Sahil Kale

This code was written for a summer project. Read about it [here](https://medvita.ca)!

In this project, I was responsible for the hardware application. <br/>
It runs on an AVR Atmega328P with a custom PCB containing:
- Medical Grade Sensors
- Multiplexers
- UART RS232 to USB interfaces
- Decoders

The code was developed in Atmel Stuido using AVR C.
