Medvita is a telehealth startup aiming to create wearable clothing with embedded sensors. Read about it [here](https://medvita.ca)!

In this project, I was responsible for the hardware application. <br/>
It runs on an AVR Atmega328P with a custom PCB containing:
- Medical Grade Sensors
- Multiplexers
- UART RS232 to USB interfaces
- Decoders

The code was developed in Atmel Stuido using AVR C.
